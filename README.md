# About

This app was built using NextJS 13, using the new "app directory" feature and is entirely server rendered.

## How to run

You will need 2 environment variables:

`RAPID_API=api-formula-1.p.rapidapi.com`

`API_KEY=yourapikey`

Once those have been setup run the app in development mode with

`npm run dev`

This will start the dev server on `localhost:3000`

Thanks!
